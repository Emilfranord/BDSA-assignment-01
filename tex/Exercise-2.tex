\section{Exercise 2}
First we categorize the git application. We see git to be both a Stand-alone applicatiton and an interactive transaction-based application.
The reasoning for these choices is that git can be both depending on how the user will use the program.
A user could create a repository with git, only work offline with commits and most of its features, making it stand-alone. 
A user could technically have a remote section locally on a different part of its computer still making it stand-alone. 
Seperately a user could use git remotely with a server that it could connect to from multiple devices, making it interactive transaction-based.
This would also be used in relations to schools, companies or groups working together where they all need to access the same repository on different devices.
Therefore, depending on how and where the user need to interact with the platform, the system can switch between two different application types.

Secondly, the Coronapas app is only seen as interactive transaction-based.
A user is unable to properly use the Coronapas app if not connected to the Coronapas app servers in one way or the other.
if a user is not connected they are not able to load the qr code to show they are valid or not valid. 
All processing of data, loading if a user is valid or not etc. is hosted Seperately through database systems and servers.
