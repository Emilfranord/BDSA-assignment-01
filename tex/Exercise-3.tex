\section{Exercise 3}
The Coronapas App, was a software product, that the danish goverment wanted to get made.
They wrote a public offering, contining the requrements for the app, and then companies could submit their bids.
Therefore the app is a Customized software product, because the purchaser is in charge of the requrements. 

On the other hand, Git is a Generic product.
This is the case because the actors who use git, have no say in what it does, and what requrements it needs to uphold.
It is also avalible for all to get, hence it is generic.

% Describe for the Coronapas App and Git what kind of software product they are and provide arguments for your believes.
