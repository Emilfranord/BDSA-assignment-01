\section{Exercise 4}
Three systems will be compared, namely the Coronapas App, Git, and a Insulin pump control system.

\subsection{Dependability}
% Coronapas App

% Git

% Insulin pump control system

\subsection{Security}
Clearly all of the systems need to be secure.
For the Coronapas App, missing secutity could allow malicious actors to get hold of peoples health data, or allow a malicious actor to have a fake clearence.
This would be problematic for the customer, the danish government.
For git, it could cause publication or changes to code repos, or other files tracked via it.
The Insulin pump control system, too needs to be kept secure from outside interferance.
Not doing so could cause the system to deliver too much insulin to the end user, killing them.

Sometimes security for embeded systems, and systems that are not connected to othes, is not prioritized.
This could be the case for the Insulin pump control system, with the argument that there are no obvious attack vectors.
Hence the business of The Insulin pump control system might not put an emphasis on security.


\subsection{Efficiency}
% Coronapas App

% Git

% Insulin pump control system



\subsection{Maintainability}
Maintainability is only relevant, if there are changing needs of customers.
For the Coronapas App, it was a shortlived, approximately 2 years, and had a defined set of requrements from the beginning.
Hence, there was not a significant need for maintainability within the app.

Similarly, the Insulin pump control system does not have not a significant need for maintainability.
That is, once the pump works and operates correctly, the needs of customers should not change too much.
It is not that there will be no changes to the requremnts, but they will be few and far between.

Contrary to those examples, git often has changes to its needs.
The source code repo for git has over 67000 commits, and as such it gets changed really often.
In principal, there does not need to be a change to the needs of git's customers, but there are.
Hence gits business or devs has placed a high prioriry on maintainability


% Sommerville discusses quality of professional software, non-functional quality attributes, or product characteristics. 
% Compare the Coronapas App, Git, and the Insulin pump control system (see SE chap 1.3.1) with respect to the quality attributes dependability, security, efficiency, and maintainability.

% Do they all share the same characteristics with regards to these quality attributes or are these of varying importance to the three systems? 
% Give examples for each of the three systems with regards to each of the quality attributes above.
